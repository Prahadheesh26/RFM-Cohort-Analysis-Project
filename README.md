### 2️⃣ RFM Analysis
**RFM Metrics:**
- **Recency** – How recently a customer made a purchase
- **Frequency** – How often a customer purchases
- **Monetary** – How much money a customer spends

**Steps:**
- Calculated RFM values for each customer
- Assigned RFM scores using quantiles
- Segmented customers into meaningful groups:
  - Champions
  - Loyal Customers
  - At Risk
  - Lost Customers

---

### 3️⃣ Cohort Analysis
- Grouped customers by **first purchase month**
- Calculated monthly retention rates
- Created **cohort matrices**
- Visualized retention using heatmaps

---

## 📈 Visualizations
- RFM Score Distributions
- Customer Segmentation Charts
- Cohort Retention Heatmaps
- Monthly Retention Trends

---

## 🔍 Key Insights
- Identified **high-value and loyal customers**
- Discovered customer churn patterns
- Found retention drop-off points
- Provided data-driven recommendations for marketing strategies
